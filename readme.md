# 🥤 Beverage Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts the **price range of a beverage** based on customer demographics, preferences, and consumption behavior.

It demonstrates a complete ML lifecycle including:
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training & Comparison
- Experiment Tracking using **MLflow**
- Best Model Selection
- Deployment using **Streamlit** for real-time predictions

## 🧪 What the App Does

The web app takes user inputs such as:
- Age Group
- Zone
- Income Level
- Consumption Frequency
- Brand Preference
- Health Concerns
- Packaging Preference
- Purchase Channel, etc.

It then:
- Applies the same feature engineering pipeline
- Uses the trained ML model
- Predicts the **most likely price range** of the beverage.

---

## 📈 MLflow Experiment Tracking

- All experiments are logged
- Model metrics (accuracy) are tracked
- Multiple models are compared
- Best model is selected based on performance

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Beverage companies for pricing strategy
- Marketing & product positioning teams
- Market research and customer segmentation analysis
- Data science learning & portfolio project
